Could you explain it to me step-by-step?\\n\\nTeacher: Of course! Let's break it down. The problem is to evaluate the integral \\\\(\\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi}(x-\\\\pi)^2 (\\\\sin x) dx\\\\).\\n\\nStudent: Okay, I see the integral. But why do we need to use substitution here?\\n\\nTeacher: Good question. Using substitution can simplify the integral. We let \\\\( t = x - \\\\pi \\\\). This substitution helps us center the integral around zero, which can make it easier to apply symmetry properties.\\n\\nStudent: I see. So, what happens to the limits of integration when we make this substitution?\\n\\nTeacher: When \\\\( x = 0 \\\\), \\\\( t = -\\\\pi \\\\). When \\\\( x = 2\\\\pi \\\\), \\\\( t = \\\\pi \\\\). So, the new limits of integration are from \\\\(-\\\\pi\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\pi\\\\).\\n\\nStudent: Got it.

So, how does the integral transform after the substitution?\\n\\nTeacher: The integral \\\\(\\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} (x-\\\\pi)^2 \\\\sin x \\\\, dx\\\\) becomes \\\\(\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} t^2 \\\\sin(t+\\\\pi) \\\\, dt\\\\).\\n\\nStudent: I'm a bit confused about \\\\(\\\\sin(t+\\\\pi)\\\\). Can you explain that part?\\n\\nTeacher: Sure. We know that \\\\(\\\\sin(t+\\\\pi) = -\\\\sin t\\\\). This is a trigonometric identity. So, the integral becomes \\\\(\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} t^2 (-\\\\sin t) \\\\, dt\\\\), which simplifies to \\\\(-\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} t^2 \\\\sin t \\\\, dt\\\\).\\n\\nStudent: Okay, I understand that. But why does the integral evaluate to zero?\\n\\nTeacher: The key here is to recognize that \\\\( t^2 \\\\) is an even function and \\\\(\\\\sin t\\\\) is an odd function. The product \\\\( t^2 \\\\sin t \\\\) is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over symmetric limits \\\\([-a, a]\\\\) is zero.\\n\\nStudent: Ah, I see. So, the integral \\\\(\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} t^2 \\\\sin t \\\\, dt\\\\) is zero because \\\\( t^2 \\\\sin t \\\\) is an odd function?\\n\\nTeacher: Exactly. The integral of an odd function over symmetric limits is zero. Therefore, the value of the integral \\\\(\\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi}(x-\\\\pi)^2 (\\\\sin x) dx\\\\) is \\\\(0\\\\).\\n\\nStudent: Thank you, that clears up a lot of my confusion. So, the correct answer is \\\\(0\\\\).\\n\\nTeacher: Yes, the correct answer is \\\\(0\\\\). I'm glad I could help you understand the solution.\"}\n",

The slope of the given line is 5. We can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is \\\\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\\\), where \\\\(m\\\\) is the slope and \\\\((x_1, y_1)\\\\) is the point the line passes through.

How do I solve the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{n}{15} \\\\times 3 - 9.5 = 45.5\\\\)?\\nQwen: Let's solve the equation step by step.

According to the problem, in 5 years, Fred will be twice as old as Bill:\\n\\\\[ b + 30 = 2(b + 5) \\\\]\\nSimplify and solve for \\\\(b\\\\):\\n\\\\[ b + 30 = 2b + 10 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 20 = b \\\\]\\nSo, Bill is 20 years old. Fred's age is:\\n\\\\[ b + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \\\\]\\nTherefore, Bill is 20 years old and Fred is 45 years old.\\n\\nUser: A farmer has 72 animals, goats and chickens together they have 168 legs.

We have two equations:\\n\\\\[ g + c = 72 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 4g + 2c = 168 \\\\]\\nFrom the first equation, solve for \\\\(c\\\\):\\n\\\\[ c = 72 - g \\\\]\\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\\n\\\\[ 4g + 2(72 - g) = 168 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 4g + 144 - 2g = 168 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2g = 24 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ g = 12 \\\\]\\nSo, there are 12 goats.\\n\\nUser: In 1990, the populations of town A and town B were the same.

The population of town B in 2000 is given by:\\n\\\\[ 0.8p = 24000 \\\\]\\nSolve for \\\\(p\\\\):\\n\\\\[ p = \\\\frac{24000}{0.8} = 30000 \\\\]\\nThe population of town A in 2000 is:\\n\\\\[ 1.6p = 1.6 \\\\times 30000 = 48000 \\\\]\\nSo, the population of town A in 2000 was 48,000.\"}\n",

The document says that if I have a Near-Clique problem instance, I can construct a new Clique problem instance from it. But my intuition is that Clique is the \"harder\" problem, so wouldn\\'t you reduce the other way around, from Clique to Near-Clique? Am I thinking about this backwards?\\n\\nExpert: You are absolutely right to question that. Your intuition is correct in the context of proving NP-completeness. If our goal is to show that Near-Clique is NP-hard, we would need a reduction from a known NP-complete problem like Clique to Near-Clique. The reduction described here, from Near-Clique to Clique, is useful for a different purpose, perhaps classifying the complexity relationship between the two problems. For our discussion, we will stick to the provided reduction as it is.\\n\\nL: Okay, so let\\'s look at the construction itself. It says: \"For each edge pair of vertices `x,y \\\\in (N(u)\\\\cap N(v))`, if `xy \\\\in E(G)`, add the edge `x\\'y\\'` to `E(G\\')`.\" Could you unpack this for me? What are `x\\'` and `y\\'`?\\n\\nE: Let\\'s break it down. We start with the original graph `G`. The goal is to build `G\\'`. For every pair of vertices `(u,v)` in `G` that do not have an edge between them (i.e., `uv \\\\notin E(G)`), we are going to create a small, separate subgraph inside `G\\'`.\\n\\nThe vertices of this new subgraph will be called `x\\'`, where `x` is a vertex that is a common neighbor of both `u` and `v` in `G`. In other words, `x` is a vertex that shares an edge with `u` (`ux \\\\in E(G)`) and an edge with `v` (`vx \\\\in E(G)`). We use the notation `N(u) \\\\cap N(v)` to represent the set of all such common neighbors. So, for every vertex `x` in this set `N(u) \\\\cap N(v)`, we add a corresponding vertex `x\\'` to our new graph `G\\'`.\\n\\nNow, we need to connect these new vertices `x\\'`.\\n\\nE: To connect the new vertices, we follow the adjacency rules from the old graph. If two common neighbors `x` and `y` were connected by an edge in the original graph `G` (meaning `xy \\\\in E(G)`), then we add an edge between their corresponding copies `x\\'` and `y\\'` in the new graph `G\\'`.\\n\\nEssentially, each such subgraph in `G\\'` is an induced copy of the original graph `G`\\'s subgraph formed by the common neighbors of `u` and `v`. We do this for every non-edge `(u,v)` in the original graph `G`.\\n\\nL: That makes sense. So `G\\'` gets built by gluing together many of these small, induced subgraph \"patches,\" one for each missing edge in `G`.\\n\\nE: Exactly.\\n\\nL: And then it says to set `k\\' = k-2`. Why subtract two?\\n\\nE: The idea is that any large near-clique `S` in `G` of size `|S|=k` must be missing exactly one edge to be a full clique, say the edge `(u,v)`. This means that the `k-2` other vertices in the set (i.e., `S \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}`) must form a complete subgraph among themselves, and each of them must be connected to both `u` and `v`.\\n\\nWhen we build `G\\'`, the vertices of this `k-2` sized clique are represented by the vertices `x\\'` within the specific subgraph corresponding to the non-edge `(u,v)`. Therefore, if we can find a clique of size `k\\'` in `G\\'`, it directly corresponds to a set of vertices that formed a `(k-2)`-sized clique in `G` within the neighborhood of some pair `(u,v)`. This gives us `k-2` vertices ready to be part of a near-clique, with `u` and `v` being the final two vertices to complete it.\\n\\nL: Ah, I see! The `k\\'` is set aside just for the \"inner\" clique part, not including the two vertices `u` and `v`.\\n\\nE: Precisely. Now, let\\'s look at the first direction of the proof: if `G` has a near-clique of size `k`, then `G\\'` must have a clique of size `k-2`. It says: \"let `D` be the vertices of the near-clique. Then there are two vertices `u,v \\\\in D` such that `uv \\\\notin E(G)`... and `D \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}` forms a clique of size `k-2`, and `D \\\\subseteq N(u)\\\\cap N(v)`.\"\\n\\nE: Let\\'s dissect this. By the definition of a near-clique, the set of vertices `D` is almost a clique. The only thing stopping it from being a full clique is the single missing edge. Let\\'s call the vertices of this missing edge `u` and `v`.\\n\\nBecause `D` is a near-clique, any two vertices in it, aside from `u` and `v`, must be connected. This means the set `D \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}`, which has `k-2` vertices, must form a sub-clique (a complete subgraph) within `G`.\\n\\nMoreover, for `D` to be a near-clique, the \"almost-clique\" condition requires that by adding the single edge `(u,v)`, the whole set `D` becomes a clique. For this to be true, `u` must be connected to every other vertex in `D` (including those in `D \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}`), and `v` must be connected to every other vertex in `D`.\\n\\nThis means that all the vertices in `D \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}` must be common neighbors of `u` and `v`. So, `D \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}` is a subset of `N(u) \\\\cap N(v)`.\\n\\nL: Okay, so inside the original graph `G`, we have this `k-2` vertex clique, `D \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}`, and every single one of these vertices is connected to `u` and `v`.\\n\\nE: Now let\\'s see what happens in `G\\'`. According to the construction process, for the non-edge `(u,v)` in `G`, we create a subgraph in `G\\'` from the set of common neighbors `N(u) \\\\cap N(v)`. Since `D \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}` is a subset of this set, all of its vertices are represented in this subgraph of `G\\'`.\\n\\nE: Furthermore, because `D \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}` forms a clique in `G`, all the required edges exist between its vertices. This means that in `G\\'`, where we preserve edges from `G`, the corresponding vertices will also all be connected to each other.\\n\\nTherefore, the representation of `D \\\\setminus \\\\{u,v\\\\}` forms a complete subgraph, a clique, within `G\\'`. Since this clique has `k-2` vertices, and we set `k\\' = k-2`, we have found a clique in `G\\'` of the required size.\\n\\nL: The proof goes the other way too: if `G\\'` has a `k\\'`-sized clique, then `G` has a `k`-sized near-clique. It says \"let `C\\'` be a `k\\'=k-2` size clique in `G\\'`... By the construction, there must exist `u,v\\\\in V(G)` such that `C\\\\subset N(u)\\\\cap N(v)`.\"\\nE: We pick up the argument here. The key observation is that `G\\'` is built by taking several disjoint subgraphs, one for each non-edge `(u,v)` in `G`. A clique within `G\\'` cannot have vertices from different subgraphs, because there are no edges between those separate components. So, the `k\\'`-sized clique `C\\'` must be entirely contained within one of these subgraphs.\\n\\nEvery subgraph in `G\\'` was created for a specific non-edge `(u,v)` from the original graph `G`. Therefore, if our clique `C\\'` is inside the subgraph for `(u,v)`, it means that every single vertex in `C\\'` originated from a vertex that was a common neighbor of `u` and `v` in `G`. So, if `C` is the set of original vertices corresponding to `C\\'`, then `C \\\\subset N(u) \\\\cap N(v)`. This means every vertex in `C` is connected to both `u` and `v`.\\n\\nL: That\\'s the crucial part that was confusing. The existence of the pair `(u,v)` is guaranteed because the clique `C\\'` has to live inside one of the subgraphs we built, and each subgraph was built for a specific `(u,v)` pair.\\n\\nE: Exactly. So, we have this pair `(u,v)` with no edge between them, and a set `C` of `k-2` vertices, where every vertex in `C` is connected to `u` and `v`. Now, we need to check if `C` is a clique in `G`. The document says it is, because the subgraph for `(u,v)` in `G\\'` is built by copying the edges from `G`. Since `C\\'` is a clique in `G\\'`, all the corresponding vertices in `C` must have been connected in `G`. So, `C` forms a `(k-2)`-sized clique in `G`.\\n\\nL: So now we have `u` and `v`, who are not connected, and `C`, which is a `k-2` sized clique where every vertex in `C` is connected to both `u` and `v`.\\n\\nE: Now we just assemble the near-clique. Consider the set `D = C \\\\cup \\\\{u,v\\\\}`. What are its properties?\\n1.  Its size `|D|` is `|C| + |{u,v}| = (k-2) + 2 = k`.\\n2.  The only \"missing\" edge in `D` is the one between `u` and `v`. If we were to add this edge, the set `D` would become a clique, because `u` is connected to all in `C` and `v` is connected to all in `C` (by the fact that `C \\\\subset N(u) \\\\cap N(v)`), and `C` is already a clique within itself.\\n\\nThis is precisely the definition of a `k`-sized near-clique. Therefore, we have shown that `G` contains a `k`-near-clique.\\n\\nFinally, the document points out that this whole process can be done in polynomial time. We need to examine every pair of vertices `(u,v)` in `G`. For each pair, the most expensive part of the construction is finding the intersection of their neighborhoods `N(u) \\\\cap N(v)`. If the graph has `n` vertices, there are `O(n^2)` pairs to check. Checking the neighbors for each vertex can also be done in `O(n)` time, making the total construction time `O(n^3)`, which is polynomial.'}\n",

The problem is about finding the first three terms of a sequence defined by \\\\( a_1 = 2 \\\\) and \\\\( a_n = 3(a_{n-1})^2 \\\\). Steve provided the solution, stating that the first three terms are \\\\( 2 \\\\), \\\\( 3 \\\\times 2^2 \\\\), and \\\\( 3 \\\\times (3 \\\\times 2^2)^2 \\\\), which simplify to \\\\( 2 \\\\), \\\\( 12 \\\\), and \\\\( 432 \\\\). What do you think?\\n\\nProfessor B: That's correct. Let's break it down step by step. The first term is given as \\\\( a_1 = 2 \\\\). For the second term, we use the formula \\\\( a_2 = 3(a_1)^2 \\\\). Substituting \\\\( a_1 = 2 \\\\), we get \\\\( a_2 = 3 \\\\times 2^2 = 3 \\\\times 4 = 12 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: Right, and for the third term, we use \\\\( a_3 = 3(a_2)^2 \\\\). Since \\\\( a_2 = 12 \\\\), we have \\\\( a_3 = 3 \\\\times 12^2 = 3 \\\\times 144 = 432 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: Exactly. So, the first three terms are indeed \\\\( 2 \\\\), \\\\( 12 \\\\), and \\\\( 432 \\\\). It's a good example of how quickly sequences can grow when they involve squaring and multiplication.\\n\\nProfessor A: Agreed. Moving on, I noticed a related question about an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 4, and the 1st, 3rd, and 7th terms are given. We need to determine the common difference. How would you approach this?\\n\\nProfessor B: To find the common difference, we can use the fact that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote the common difference by \\\\( d \\\\). The 1st term is \\\\( a_1 = 4 \\\\), the 3rd term is \\\\( a_3 = 4 + 2d \\\\), and the 7th term is \\\\( a_7 = 4 + 6d \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: So, we need to find \\\\( d \\\\) such that the terms fit the given sequence. If we have the values of \\\\( a_3 \\\\) and \\\\( a_7 \\\\), we can set up equations and solve for \\\\( d \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: Yes, if we know the values of \\\\( a_3 \\\\) and \\\\( a_7 \\\\), we can use the equations \\\\( a_3 = 4 + 2d \\\\) and \\\\( a_7 = 4 + 6d \\\\) to find \\\\( d \\\\). For example, if \\\\( a_3 = 10 \\\\) and \\\\( a_7 = 16 \\\\), we can solve \\\\( 10 = 4 + 2d \\\\) and \\\\( 16 = 4 + 6d \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: Solving \\\\( 10 = 4 + 2d \\\\) gives \\\\( 2d = 6 \\\\), so \\\\( d = 3 \\\\). And solving \\\\( 16 = 4 + 6d \\\\) also gives \\\\( 6d = 12 \\\\), so \\\\( d = 2 \\\\). But since these must be consistent, we should check the values provided.\\n\\nProfessor B: Exactly. If the values provided are consistent, then \\\\( d = 3 \\\\) should work for both equations. Let's move on to the next question. In another problem, the first difference of a sequence is given as \\\\( 8, 12, 16, 20, \\\\ldots \\\\). We need to find the 10th term.\\n\\nProfessor A: The first difference sequence \\\\( 8, 12, 16, 20, \\\\ldots \\\\) suggests that the sequence is quadratic. The general form of a quadratic sequence is \\\\( a_n = an^2 + bn + c \\\\). The first difference sequence is \\\\( 4n + 4 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: To find the 10th term, we can use the fact that the first difference sequence is \\\\( 4n + 4 \\\\). The second difference is constant and equal to 4. We can use the formula for the sum of the first \\\\( n \\\\) terms of the first difference sequence to find the 10th term.\\n\\nProfessor A: The sum of the first \\\\( n \\\\) terms of the first difference sequence is \\\\( \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (4k + 4) \\\\). This can be simplified to \\\\( 4 \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k + 4n \\\\). Using the formula for the sum of the first \\\\( n \\\\) natural numbers, \\\\( \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\), we get \\\\( 4 \\\\left( \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\right) + 4n = 2n(n+1) + 4n = 2n^2 + 6n \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: So, the 10th term of the sequence is \\\\( 2(10)^2 + 6(10) = 200 + 60 = 260 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: That's correct. The 10th term is 260. Let's look at the next question. The 1st, 5th, and 13th terms of an arithmetic sequence are given. We need to find the common difference and the nth term.\\n\\nProfessor B: Let's denote the first term by \\\\( a \\\\) and the common difference by \\\\( d \\\\). The 1st term is \\\\( a \\\\), the 5th term is \\\\( a + 4d \\\\), and the 13th term is \\\\( a + 12d \\\\). If we have the values of these terms, we can set up equations to solve for \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: For example, if the 1st term is 3, the 5th term is 11, and the 13th term is 23, we can set up the equations \\\\( 3 + 4d = 11 \\\\) and \\\\( 3 + 12d = 23 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: Solving \\\\( 3 + 4d = 11 \\\\) gives \\\\( 4d = 8 \\\\), so \\\\( d = 2 \\\\). And solving \\\\( 3 + 12d = 23 \\\\) gives \\\\( 12d = 20 \\\\), so \\\\( d = 2 \\\\). The common difference is \\\\( d = 2 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: The nth term of the sequence is given by \\\\( a_n = a + (n-1)d \\\\). Substituting \\\\( a = 3 \\\\) and \\\\( d = 2 \\\\), we get \\\\( a_n = 3 + (n-1)2 = 3 + 2n - 2 = 2n + 1 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: So, the nth term is \\\\( 2n + 1 \\\\). Let's move on to the next question. We need to determine whether a sequence is arithmetic or geometric and find the nth term.\\n\\nProfessor A: To determine the type of sequence, we need to check if the ratio between consecutive terms is constant (geometric) or if the difference between consecutive terms is constant (arithmetic).\\n\\nProfessor B: For example, if the sequence is \\\\( 2, 6, 18, 54, \\\\ldots \\\\), the ratio between consecutive terms is \\\\( \\\\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\\\), \\\\( \\\\frac{18}{6} = 3 \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\frac{54}{18} = 3 \\\\). Since the ratio is constant, the sequence is geometric with a common ratio of 3.\\n\\nProfessor A: The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by \\\\( a_n = a \\\\cdot r^{n-1} \\\\). If the first term \\\\( a = 2 \\\\) and the common ratio \\\\( r = 3 \\\\), the nth term is \\\\( a_n = 2 \\\\cdot 3^{n-1} \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: That's correct. Let's look at the next question. The first and second terms of an exponential sequence (geometric progression, G.P.) are given. We need to find the common ratio.\\n\\nProfessor A: If the first term is \\\\( a \\\\) and the second term is \\\\( ar \\\\), the common ratio \\\\( r \\\\) can be found by dividing the second term by the first term.\\n\\nProfessor B: For example, if the first term is 5 and the second term is 15, the common ratio \\\\( r \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{15}{5} = 3 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: So, the common ratio is 3. Let's move on to the next question. In an arithmetic sequence, the common difference is equal to 2, and the first term is given. We need to find the nth term.\\n\\nProfessor B: The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \\\\( a_n = a + (n-1)d \\\\). If the first term \\\\( a = 3 \\\\) and the common difference \\\\( d = 2 \\\\), the nth term is \\\\( a_n = 3 + (n-1)2 = 3 + 2n - 2 = 2n + 1 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: So, the nth term is \\\\( 2n + 1 \\\\). Let's look at the next question. The sum of the first nine terms of an arithmetic sequence is 216. The 1st, 4th, and 9th terms are given. We need to find the common difference.\\n\\nProfessor B: The sum of the first nine terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by \\\\( S_9 = \\\\frac{9}{2} (2a + 8d) = 216 \\\\). Simplifying, we get \\\\( 9(2a + 8d) = 432 \\\\), so \\\\( 2a + 8d = 48 \\\\), or \\\\( a + 4d = 24 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: If the 1st term is \\\\( a \\\\), the 4th term is \\\\( a + 3d \\\\), and the 9th term is \\\\( a + 8d \\\\), we can set up equations using the given terms.\\n\\nProfessor B: For example, if the 1st term is 4, the 4th term is 16, and the 9th term is 28, we can set up the equations \\\\( 4 + 3d = 16 \\\\) and \\\\( 4 + 8d = 28 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: Solving \\\\( 4 + 3d = 16 \\\\) gives \\\\( 3d = 12 \\\\), so \\\\( d = 4 \\\\). And solving \\\\( 4 + 8d = 28 \\\\) gives \\\\( 8d = 24 \\\\), so \\\\( d = 3 \\\\). Since these must be consistent, we should check the values provided.\\n\\nProfessor B: Exactly. If the values provided are consistent, then \\\\( d = 4 \\\\) should work for both equations. Let's move on to the next question. The first three terms of a geometric sequence are the same as the 1st, 9th, and 27th terms of an arithmetic sequence. We need to find the common ratio.\\n\\nProfessor A: Let the first term of the geometric sequence be \\\\( a \\\\) and the common ratio be \\\\( r \\\\). The first three terms of the geometric sequence are \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( ar \\\\), and \\\\( ar^2 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be \\\\( A \\\\) and the common difference be \\\\( D \\\\). The 1st term is \\\\( A \\\\), the 9th term is \\\\( A + 8D \\\\), and the 27th term is \\\\( A + 26D \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: Setting these equal, we get \\\\( a = A \\\\), \\\\( ar = A + 8D \\\\), and \\\\( ar^2 = A + 26D \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: Solving these equations, we can find \\\\( r \\\\). For example, if \\\\( a = 2 \\\\), \\\\( ar = 10 \\\\), and \\\\( ar^2 = 26 \\\\), we can solve \\\\( 2r = 10 \\\\) to get \\\\( r = 5 \\\\) and \\\\( 2r^2 = 26 \\\\) to get \\\\( r = \\\\sqrt{13} \\\\). Since these must be consistent, we should check the values provided.\\n\\nProfessor A: Exactly. If the values provided are consistent, then \\\\( r = 3 \\\\) should work for both equations. Let's move on to the next question. A student is working on some nth term problems and wants to know if their solution is correct.\\n\\nProfessor B: We should review their work and provide feedback. If they have the correct approach and calculations, we can confirm their solution.\\n\\nProfessor A: Let's look at the final question. We need to find the next three terms in the sequence: \\\\( 1, 30, 22, 14, 6, -3, -12, -21, \\\\ldots \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: To find the next three terms, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence. The differences between consecutive terms are \\\\( 29, -8, -8, -8, -9, -9, -9 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: The differences suggest that the sequence is not arithmetic or geometric. However, the differences between the differences are \\\\( -37, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 \\\\), indicating a pattern.\\n\\nProfessor B: The next differences should follow the same pattern. So, the next differences are \\\\( -9, -9, -9 \\\\). Adding these to the last term, we get \\\\( -21 - 9 = -30 \\\\), \\\\( -30 - 9 = -39 \\\\), and \\\\( -39 - 9 = -48 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor A: So, the next three terms are \\\\( -30, -39, -48 \\\\).\\n\\nProfessor B: That's correct. The next three terms are \\\\( -30, -39, -48 \\\\).\"}\n"
